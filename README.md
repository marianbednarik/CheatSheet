# CheatSheet
An old Android app for my final school project. Won 6th place in the national yearly project competition. It is not great, but hopefully my coding practices have improved from then.

It's supposed to help students organize their school life by agregating all data from their classes. Think of ti as Github for students, where a class has a shared knowledge base of reminders, notes and _cheatsheets_. Help yourself and your classmates at the same time.
