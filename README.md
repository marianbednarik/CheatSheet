# CheatSheet
An old Android app for my final school project. Won 6th place in the national yearly project competition. It is not great, but hopefully my coding practices have improved from then.

It's supposed to help students organize their school life by aggregating all data from their classes. Think of it as Github for students, where each class has a shared knowledge base of reminders, timetables, notes and _cheatsheets_. Sharing is caring.

This repo serves as more of an archive for documentation purposes, not live/maintained anymore.

## Authentication

Athentication was done by utilizing Google's official auth flow. This allowed us to rapidly develop a secure way of authorizing users, while letting them use their existing account.

## Home screen

The homescreen was designed in a way to provide as much information as possible on what's importatn at the moment. We did't want the user to go through multiple app screens jsut to find what class is next. This allows people to gather a lot of information at a glance, while still allowing them to dive deeper when necessary.
